                  input.value = input.value + num;
               }
               for (let item of items) {
                  item.addEventListener('click', () => {
                     let number = item.innerHTML;
                     input.value = input.value + number;
                  })
               }
               clean.addEventListener('click', () => {
                  input.value = '';
               })
               back.addEventListener('click', () => {
                  let exp = input.value;
                  input.value = exp.substring(0, exp.length - 1);
               })
               equal.addEventListener('click', () => {
                  let exp = input.value;
                  if (exp) {
                     input.value = eval(exp);
                  }
               })
